Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a process used to understand the characteristics, structure, and patterns within a dataset. Here's a brief overview of typical steps involved:

1. Data Collection: Obtain the dataset from a reliable source.
  
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicate entries.

3. Data Transformation: Normalize or standardize values, if needed.

4. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate measures like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

5. Data Visualization: Use graphs and charts (like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots) to understand the distribution and relationship between variables.

6. Pattern Recognition: Identify correlations, trends, and anomalies in the data.

7. Feature Engineering: Create new features based on existing ones to better capture underlying patterns.

8. Summary: Interpret findings, prepare reports, and guide further analysis or predictive modeling.

The aim is to gain insights that can guide further data processing or model building.
